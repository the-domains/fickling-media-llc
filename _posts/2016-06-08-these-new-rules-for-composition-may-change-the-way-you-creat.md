  Rules are made to be broken, even when you're working with something as
  seemingly uncompromising as composition. A visually appealing image is equal
  parts creativity, mathematics, and intuition. There are many concepts that
  teach us how to assemble elements within a frame to give it the maximum amount
  of aesthetic energy-the rule of thirds, symmetry, balance, etc.-but they
  certainly aren't the only ways to make that happen.
