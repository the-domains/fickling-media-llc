  As you may have seen on our Facebook page we have discontinued our Private
  Investigation and Process Services in order to focus more on various projects.
  One of those projects is the Honey Bee Project which we will be documenting
  and sharing information about how one can help with the declining bee
  population through urban beekeeping. We look forward to announcing our new
  website for this project soon.
